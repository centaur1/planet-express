# Planet Express

***WIP branch for ipfs pubsub version***

## Extra Requirements

You need to have go-ipfs binary built from the IPFS pubsub branch https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/tree/feat/floodsub. You need to have the daemon running before starting Planet Express (at port 5001).

## Run

Currently only the Electron app works.

#### Requirements

- Node.js v6.x.x
- npm v3.x.x
- g++, gcc, make (for building native modules)
- python 2 (for building, some native modules need it, node-fibers perhaps?)

#### Get the source code
```
git clone https://github.com/haadcode/planet-express.git
cd planet-express/
```

#### Install dependencies
```
npm install
rm -rf node_modules/ipfs/node_modules/ipfs-api/
rm -rf node_modules/ipfsd-ctl/node_modules/ipfs-api/
cd client/
npm install
rm -rf node_modules/ipfs-api
rm -rf node_modules/ipfs/node_modules/ipfs-api/
```

##### Build Client
```
cd client/
npm run build
```

##### Run Electron App

*Run this is in project's root directory, not in `client/`.*

```
npm run electron
```

The application executable is in `dist/`.

### Development

#### Run Tests

```
npm test
```

#### Electron App Development

First, start the desktop app in developer mode:
```
npm run dev:electron
```

Then, start the UI development environment:
```
cd client/
npm run dev
```
